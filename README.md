# Telemedicine-app
    In this app, it will have the following features;
    1. Mobile app (Am not so sure how I can do this), I might make the website responsive.
    2. Web app tailored for doctores.
    3. Web app for patients.
    4. web-based admin area- for management purposes.
    
    -In the mobile app its going to have features like user login, regestration, a doctor search function, video chat capability, scheduling tools, history of past appointment, (I might add, sms verification for security purposes)

    -The web app, will be quite similar to the mobile app when it comes to the features however, I would add features like, user interface that will be easier for navigation.

    -For the doctors side, the functionality, will be registration capabilities, verifaction processes, scheduling appointments , the ability to set availability, managing and setting thier profiles.

    - In the admin zone, it will have features like patients and doctors managemnet, verification processes, appointment oversight.
    
    -Backend: Provides APIs for all modules, handles data management, user authentication, and SMS verification.
